# Formatted Strings

# 1)Concatenating strings:

# we can concatenate strings in two ways:


word1 = "Atharva"
word2 = "Agre"

# 1st way:
full_name = word1 + " " + word2

# 2nd wayy:
Full_name = f"first name:{word1}\nLast name:{word2}"
print(Full_name)

print(full_name.upper())
print(full_name.lower())
print(full_name.rstrip())
print(full_name.rsplit())
print(full_name.title())
print(full_name.find("Agr"))
print(full_name[:])
print(full_name[3:])
print(full_name[:5])
print(full_name[3:9])
